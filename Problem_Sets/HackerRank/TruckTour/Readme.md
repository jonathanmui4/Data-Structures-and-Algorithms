# Intuition
<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->
Iteration problem.


# Approach
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->
Iterate through array. Hard code starting index to 0, same as where the loop starts. For each petrol station, calculate if petrol remaining in the car is negative. If it is, starting index is incremented to i + 1. Else, continue with the loop

# Complexity
- Time complexity:
<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->
Iterate through array
$$O(n)$$

- Space complexity:
<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->
Additional Data Structures used take up constant space
$$O(1)$$
