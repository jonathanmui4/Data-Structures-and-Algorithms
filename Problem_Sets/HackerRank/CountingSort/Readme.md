# Intuition
<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->
Simple problem. 

# Approach
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->
Create another array with size of 100, all initialized to 0. Iterate through the input array, for each number in the input array, increment the index in the frequency array by 1.

# Complexity
- Time complexity:
<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->
Iterating through array once.
$$O(n)$$

- Space complexity:
<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->
Additional space used is constant
$$O(1)$$
