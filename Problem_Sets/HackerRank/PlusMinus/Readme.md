# Intuition
<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->
Keep track of the number of positive, negative nos and 0s iterating through the array. Print the fraction: count/arr.size()

# Approach
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->
Use 3 variables to keep track of the 3 counts.

# Complexity
- Time complexity:
<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->
Iterate through entire array
$$O(n)$$

- Space complexity:
<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->
Just the array of integers
$$O(n)$$
